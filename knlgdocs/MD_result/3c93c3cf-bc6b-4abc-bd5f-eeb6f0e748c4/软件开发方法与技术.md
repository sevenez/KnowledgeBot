# 计算机系统 $=$ 硬件(略) $^ +$ 软件

# 对软件的认识(1)

■工具观一软件是一种代替、强化和延伸人类思维能力的工具。

■逻辑观一计算机的思考方式是形式逻辑、形式逻辑通过建立一种可机械实现的符号演算机制，模拟了人类思维中的一类精确推理过程（如形式化语言、有限状态自动机理论）

■计算观一计算的实质就是寻找一种可机械执行的算法。例如，著名的计算模型：图灵机（被公认为现代计算机的祖先）。

组成观一软件可以用两个简单的算式来概括：（1）软件 $=$ 程序 $^ +$ 文档(2）程序 $=$ 算法 $^ +$ 数据结构

模型观一从模型论的角度看，整个软件系统是客户业务实现的一个模型，特别是软件的研制过程就是一个建模和模型间的演绎过程。

# 对软件的认识(2)

集成观一各种软件、硬件资源的集成  
结构观- 决策层是企业应用 过对下面几层软件系统数据的分析、挖掘 决策层是企业应用软件体系的最高层，通通过规划论、决策论、对策论及数理统计的有关模型，对企业的决策层提供辅助决策层 支持管理层 管理层的软件系统为企业的管理机构提供服务.如统计报表等作业控制层作业层 作业控制层的应用系统主要是为作业层提供一个协作和控制的环境基础层，位于这个层次的软件系统的主要功能代替了传统的手工劳动 10

# 对软件的认识(3)

■工程观一软件工程原理

对象观一00A&D理论认为，现实世界是由对象构成的，对象是具有特殊属性和行为的实体，对象间具有共性、层次性、继承性和关联性，反应了客观世界从普遍到一般、从个性到共性及相互制约的运动规律。从这个角度，软件的开发可视为"类"的抽象及其关联的建模过程，软件的运行是对象的实例化及其状态的演变过程。

# 对软件的认识(4)

生存期一根据ISO/IEC12207软件生命周期标准，一个通用的软件生命周期模型：（1）定义阶段（计划、需求分析）；（2）开发阶段（概要设计、详细设计、编码、集成测试、试运行和验收）；（3）运行维护

质量观一一种三维软件质量衡量：（1）软件运行（正确性、可用性、强壮性、安全性、性能）；（2）软件维护（可理解性、可扩展性、易维护性、灵活性）； (3）软件移植(可移植性、可复用性、互操作性)

# 对软件的认识(5)

人机工程观一好的系统应该易于学习、理解和掌握；界面应该简洁。

# 1.What is software?

Computer programs and associated documentation 马+医

Software products may be developed for a particular customer or may be developed for a general market   
Software products may be Generic - developed to be sold to a range of different customers Bespoke (custom) - developed for a single customer according to their specification

# What is software (cont.)

Software is a set of items or objects that form a "configuration" that includes

Programs documents data ...

# [2.What is software engineering(1)

Software engineering is an engineering discipline which is concerned with all aspects of software production

Software engineers should adopt a systematic and organised approach to their work use appropriate tools and techniques depending on the problem to be solved, the development constraints and the resources available

# What is software Engineering(2)

# IEEE, 1990:

□ (1) The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of [quality] software [and software services] that is, the application of engineering to software.

□ (2) The study of approaches as in (1)

# Why Software Engineering?

1.Software development is hard !   
Important to distinguish “easy" systems (one developer, one user, experimental use only) from “hard" systems (multiple developers, multiple users, products)   
Experience with “easy" systems is misleading One person techniques do not scale up   
Analogy with bridge building: Over a stream $=$ easy, one person job Over River Severn ... ？ (the techniques do not scale)

# Why Software Engineering ?(cont.)

2.The problem is complexity   
Many sources, but size is key: UNIX contains 4 million lines of code Windows 2000 contains $4 0 ^ { \circ }$ lines of code

Software engineering is about managing this complexity.

# 3.Software Engineering - Computer Science

CS to SE is as Chemistry to CE.   
CS and programming languages are only tools to SE.   
SE is an art and need to be an engineering.   
Any one can write code to solve a problem but only SE can produce code that is robust and easy to understand and maintain and does it in most efficient way.

# 4.What is the difference between software engineering and system engineering(1)

System engineering is concerned with all aspects of computer-based systems development including hardware, software and process engineering

Software engineering is part of this process

System engineers are involved in system specification, architectural design, integration and deployment

# What is the difference between software engineering and computer science(2)

# Computer Science

# Software Engineering

is concerned with

> theory fundamentals

the practicalities of developing delivering useful software

Computer science theories are currently insufficient to act as a complete underpinning for software engineering

# 5.What is a software process?

A set of activities whose goal is the development or evolution of software   
Generic activities in all software processes are: Specification and verification- what the system should do and its development constraints Development - production of the software system Validation - checking that the software is what the customer wants Evolution - changing the software in response to changing demands

# What is a Software Engineering Process ?

Defines Who is doing What, When to do it, and How to reach a certain goal.

New or Change Software-Engineering New or Changed Requirements Process System

The software engineering process is the process of developing a system from requirements, either new or changed. It is a controlled approach to a development task which follows a number of predefined activities and milestones and has a means to control and monitor the progress.

# 16.What is a software process model?

A simplified representation of a software process,   
presented from a specific perspective   
Examples of process perspectives: Workflow perspective represents inputs, outputs and dependencies Data-flow perspective represents data transformation activities Role/action perspective represents the roles/activities of the people involved in software process

Generic process models

Waterfall   
Evolutionary development   
Formal transformation   
Integration from reusable components

# 7.What are the costs of software engineering?

Roughly $⨏ _ { 0 } ^ { \infty } [ 0 ] ^ { \infty }$ of costs are development costs, $4 0 \%$ are testing costs. For custom software, evolution costs often exceed development costs

Costs vary depending on the type of system being developed and the requirements of system atributes such as performance and system reliability

Distribution of costs depends on the development model that is used

# 9.What is CASE ? (Computer-Aided Software Engineering)

Software systems which are intended to provide automated support for software process activities, such as requirements analysis, system modelling, debugging and testing

# Upper-CASE

Tools to support the early process activities of requirements and design

# Lower-CASE

Tools to support later activities such as programming, debugging and testing

# 8.What are software engineering methods?

Structured approaches to software development which include system models, notations, rules, design advice and process guidance

Model descriptions (Descriptions of graphical models which should be produced)

Rules (Constraints applied to system models) Recommendations (Advice on good design practice) Process guidance (What activities to follow)

# 10. What are the attributes of good software?

The software should deliver the required functionality and performance to the user and should be maintainable, dependable and usable.

Maintainability: Software must evolve to meet changing needs Dependability: Software must be trustworthy Efficiency: Software should not make wasteful use of system

# resources

Usability: Software must be usable by the users for whichit was designed

# 11.What are the key challenges facing software engineering?

Software engineering in the $2 1 \mathrm { s t }$ century faces three key challenges:

Legacy systems: Old, valuable systems must be maintained and

# updated

Heterogeneity: Systems are distributed and include a mix of hardware and software

Delivery: There is increasing pressure for faster delivery of software

# The Nature of Software (Brooks)

Modeling language and tools

# Software Development Why is it so Challenging (Difficult) ?

Software development is a highly intellectual activity and so is heavily dependent on human thought.

· No valid theoretical models of software development exist.

No laws of “software physics" that can define logical constraints and relationships between various variables in the project and product environment.

# IThe Rational Unified Process(RUP)

# 2 Phases and Iterations (1)

A phase is the span of time between two major milestones of the process in which a well-defined set of objectives are met, artifacts are completed, and decisions are made whether to move into the next phase.

Four phases:

$_ \mathrm { s }$ Inception - Establish the business case for the project ? Elaboration - Establish a project plan and a sound architecture Construction - Grow the system ③ Transition - Supply the system to its end users

An iteration represents a complete development cycle, from requirements capture in analysis to implementation and testing, that results in the release of an executable project.

# Software Development Methodology

# 2 Software Development Approaches

: The past - basic/c/pascal/fortran etc.

Procedural programs Deterministic execution Program in control

· The present- $\mathbf { c } { \mathrm { + + } }$ /Java/python etc.

Interactive program Event-driven execution Objects

. Structured vs. Object-Oriented

# 1 The Three Dimensions of a System

Static: Represents the static, structural, "data" aspects of a system.

Dynamic: Represents the temporal, behavioral, “control" aspects of a system.

Functional: Represents the transformational, “function" aspects of a system.

Functional (flow/processes) Static Dynamic (Objects) (events/states)

# 3 The Structured Approach

■结构：是指系统内各组成要素之间的相互联系、相互作用的框架。

结构化方法：强调结构的合理性，以及所开发的软件结构合理性，由此提出了一组提高软件结构合理性的准则，如分解和抽象、模块的独立性、信息隐藏等。针对不同的开发活动、它有结构化分析、结构化设计、结构化编程和结构化测试。

■IBM的“输入－加工-输出”（简称IPO）80年代流行的开发方法

# 3 The Structured Approach(2)

□ Modeling Techniques

Functional Decomposition Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) State Diagrams (STDs) Data Dictionaries 中 Structure Charts

# · Problems

Sequential and transformational . Inflexible solutions ■ No reuse

# 4 The Object Oriented Approach(1)

20世纪50年代人工智能语言LISP引入了动态联编（dynamic binding)和交互式开发环境的思想；60年代后期的离散事件模拟语言SIMULA67首次引入类的概念和继承机制；70年代的抽象数据类型，尤以CLU语言、MODULA-2语言和Ada语言影响较大。

但真正的面向对象程序设计的兴起，主要应归功于Xeror公司的PaloAIto研究中心（PARC）的Dynabook项目。该项目采用的程序设计语言Smalltalk-72， 1981推出SmalItalk-80.

面向对象方法起源于面向对象编程语言。自20世纪80年代中期到90年代，面向对象的研究重点已从编程语言转移到程序设计方法学上来。

# 4 The Object Oriented Approach(2)

The focus is on: Responsibility and Roles Co-operation and Collaboration between objects

The 3 aspects of a system (Function, Data and Behavior) are melted into one concept and are considered as one unit

# 5 Structured vs. Object Oriented

In structured approach the system decomposition (divideand-conquer) is primarily by function or process, resulting in a hierarchical breakdown of processes composed of subprocesses. This is a solution oriented approach.

In Object Oriented approach the problem space is decomposed by objects. This is a problem domain oriented approach.

# 6 Structured vs. OO Example

# Software Modeling

# 1 What is a Model ?

A model is an abstraction of something for the purpose of understanding it before building it.

Models serve several purposes:

$^ *$ Understanding the problem Testing a physical entity before building it Communication with customers Visualization   
$\circleddash$ Reduction of complexity   
$\Game$ Finding errors and omissions   
$^ *$ Planning the design   
$\Join$ Generating code

# 2 Why do we model?

□ Furnish abstractions to manage complexity. Provide structure for problem solving. Experiment to explore multiple solutions. Reduce time-to-market for business problem solutions.   
□ Decrease development costs.   
□ Manage the risk of mistakes.

# 3 What is Visual Modeling?

Order "Modeling captures essential parts of the system." Dr. James Rumbaugh Item Ship via Business Process Visual Modeling is modeling using standard graphical Computer System notations

# 4 Object Modeling Methods

Following is a list of the most common methods that are in use:

$^ *$ OOD G. Booch 1991   
\* HOOD HOOD Technical Group 1993   
OOA S. Shlaer and S. Mellor 1988, 1992

# 5 Object Management Group (OMG)

Was founded in April 1989 by eleven companies, including 3Com, American Airlines, Canon, Data General, HP, Philips, Sun and Unisys Corporation.   
Establishment of industry guidelines and standardized object software modeling to provide a common framework for application development.

# 6 What is the UML ?

OMG's Unified Modeling LanguageTM (UMLTM) Helps you specify, visualize, and document models of software systems, including their structure and design, in a way that meets all of these requirements.

UML stands for Unified Modeling Language   
The UML is the standard language for visualizing,   
specifying, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of a software-intensive system   
It can be used with all processes, throughout the   
development life cycle, and across different implementation technologies.

# 7 Unified Modeling Language $\lrcorner$ UML

The UML is a notational system (including semantics for its notations) aimed at modeling system using object-oriented concepts. The UML has been accepted as an industry standard for object-oriented modeling by OMG (Object Management Group, an industry standards body). The UML is a language for software modeling; it does not guide a developer in how to do object-oriented analysis and design or what development process to follow, but it provides framework and the communication mechanism in the process of designing OO systems.

# The basic building blocks of UML

model elements (classes, interfaces, components, use cases,   
etc.)   
relationships (associations, generalization, dependencies, etc.)   
diagrams (class diagrams, use case diagrams, interaction   
diagrams, etc.)

Simple building blocks are used to create large, complex structures.

# Formal Modeling Methods
